# PhotoSticker 

A [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app made by [Radium Rocket](https://radiumrocket.com/).

## Requirements

This page will help you set up your computer to be able to run and build the app. If you already have React Native installed, you can skip ahead to the Step.

Go to [page](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and choose **React Native CLI Quickstart**. 

## Installation

To run the project locally, you must run the following commands in the terminal.

*Install npm dependencies:*

## Server

The stickers are stored in a mongoDB database, you can see it [here](b.com/databases/photosticker).

To manage the stickers, we added a controller on the current website server ([repo](https://bitbucket.org/radiumrocketapps/radiumrocketweb/src/master/)), with the needed endpoints to create, edit and remove stickers and update the database.
